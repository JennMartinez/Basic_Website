# Basic_Website

A work in progress. I am building a website that is dedicated to current or in remission cancer patients/survivorship.

The website is addressed as an acronym: CR2C "Cancer Resources to Communities."

It is a local deploy as of now; however, I will utilize Heroku to deploy once the build is complete.

Currently, I am using HTML, Bootstrap, and custom css styling for my framework. 

A main goal in this build will be to, create a zip code radius search bar, based on an individual's location. That location will create a
list of actual resources. I will research for a reputable API that will serve the needs and goal of this build. 

Each individual that visits the CR2C site, has the option to become a member for free, which will create a community within the CR2C site. 

In order to accomplish my goal for individuals to become members, I want to create a database that stores their information, and allows them to interact with one another, with their privacy at the forefront as well.

A login will eventually accompany the member login for the website. However, the goal for free membership and the various builds behind this goal are 'ice box' at this moment.

Another goal is, to make the entire website mobile responsive for the ease of use and on the go.

I am creating an original logo for the website using Photoshop.

When the website is a complete build, it will contain resources within an individuals community for various cancer issues/supports.
