# Basic_Website

A work in progress. I am building a website that is dedicated to current or past cancer patients/survivorship.

The website is addressed as an acronym: CR2C "Cancer Resources To Communities."

It is a local deploy as of now; however, I will utilize Heroku to deploy once the build is complete.

Currently, I am using HTML, Bootstrap, and custom css styling for my framework. 

A main goal in this build will be to, create a zip code radius search bar, based on an individual's location. That location will create a
list of actual resources. I will research for a reputable API that will serve the needs and goal of this build. 

Another goal is, make the entire website mobile responsive.

When the website is a complete build, it will contain resources within an individuals community for various cancer issues/supports.
