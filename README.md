# Basic_Website

A work in progress. I am building a website that is dedicated to current or past cancer patients/survivorship.

I am using HTML, Bootstrap, and custome css styling for my framework. 

A main goal in this build will be to, create a zipcode radius search bar, based on an individual's location. That location will create a
list of actual resources.

When the website is a complete build, it will contain resources within an individuals community for various cancer issues/supports.
